As everything is connected to the internet today, we need to have a clear concept for security when it comes to products.

So in order for one to create the tech of the future, one must understand all the risks that exists in the given tech.

A way to enforce these risks, an AI is typically implemented to run some tests whenever new features or changes are introduced, to validate that there are no "open doors" into the product.

It is important to note that \textbf{it is impossible to be 100\% secure. No product/software is completely safe}.
