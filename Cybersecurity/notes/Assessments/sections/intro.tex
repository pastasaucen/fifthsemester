\textbf{What is metasploit?}: Framework for penetrationtesting.

\textbf{What is penetrationtesting?}: Checking the systems configuration for obvious flaws.

The tricky part is to know how and where to extend the attacksurface of the vulnurability.

\subsection{Vulnurabilities and exploits}
System $\leftarrow$ Vulnurability $\leftarrow$ Exploit

The exploit is called "shellcode" or "payload".

Not everyone will find the vulnurability, and some may be found accidentally.

Not everyone will be able to build an exploit.
